Ciclopes is a software developed by Dr. Babcock. It is designed to detect and trace the path of the bowling ball that has traveled down a lane from an external view. The input is a video file that requires calibration based on the camera position but can generally be placed in any position that has visibility of the full lane. This software lets users easily view their bowling shots' external metrics. It is one of the two legacy innovations of the RevMetrix project.
