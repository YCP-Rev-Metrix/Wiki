## NuGet Package
Things have changed, instead of pulling the project from GitHub, you can now use it from GitHub Packages as a standard NuGet package.

In order to do this, please add the RevMetrix GitHub as a NuGet source (may be called feeds in Rider).
When adding this source, the name should be **RevMetrix** and the actual source will be [https://nuget.pkg.github.com/YCP-Rev-Metrix/index.json](https://nuget.pkg.github.com/YCP-Rev-Metrix/index.json).

We must now validate ourselves to this new source, [go to github and add a classic token](https://github.com/settings/tokens), set the expiration to one Year and be sure to select Read and Write permissions to Packages. (See example below).
Create the token and copy the value (you will not be able to re-access). Now, go to add a package from RevMetrix just as you normally would, but this time you will be asked for a username and password.
The username is your GitHub username and the password is the value of the token we created earlier.

Congrats, you can now access RevMetrix private Packages. Please install the Client package, this will also install the Common one at the same time.
