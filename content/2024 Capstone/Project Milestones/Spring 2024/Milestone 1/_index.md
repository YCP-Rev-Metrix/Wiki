### Milestone 1
#### Main Task
1. Your task is to demonstrate your progress toward the goals you previously established for Milestone 1.

#### The Presentation / Demonstration
1. Each project team should plan to present for about 50-60 minutes. Larger teams (with multiple sub-teams) will likely go longer than that. There will likely also be an extensive question and answer period.
2. You should use presentation software such as PowerPoint or Google Slides. Your slides should contain brief bulleted points and graphics (tables, diagrams, screen captures, wire frames) that provide overall context for your bullet points. Slides should not be a “wall of text”, and please avoid reading your slides or from a prepared script.
3. Your presentation should include the following elements:
    - Provide a brief description of the project.
    - Provide a high-level overview of your system architecture.
    - Explain what tools/technologies you are using, and what role they play in your project development.
    - Explain what parts of your design are implemented, and which parts remain to be implemented by referencing your updated UML diagram(s) and Database Schema.
    - Demonstrate the system in action. Walk through your UI (and/or internal workflow) and explain the Use Case functionality it demonstrates.
    - Discuss your automated test strategy, and run your unit tests to demonstrate your testing framework, and describe what is happening.
    - Briefly talk about how you plan to evolve the system to implement the remaining functionality.
