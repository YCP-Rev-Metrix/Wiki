      <description>Description The SmartDot Simulator will be used for sending test data from Visualizer to mobile app. The Visualizer will output csv files containing acceleration and light data. The SmartDot Simulator will imitate the SmartDot module in functionality with one difference. Instead of sampling real acceleration and light data, it will read the appropriate data from the csv file it got from the visualizer. The SmartDot Simulator will also create a binary file containing the data and will send it over bluetooth to the mobile app.</description>

      <description>Description The Visualizer will be used for generating test data for the system. It will will simulate the ball path as it travels down the lane and store the acceleration and light data that the SmartDOt would sample. It then writes that data into a CSV file and sends it to the SmartDot Simulator. The Visualizer also has a virtual camera that will record a video of the throw. The developers will hand this video off to the front end team to use in their Ciclops testing.</description>
